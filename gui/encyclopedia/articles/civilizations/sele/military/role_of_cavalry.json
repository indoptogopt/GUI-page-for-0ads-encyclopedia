    "subtitle": "Why the empire was reliant on its horsemen",
    "content": "The Seleucid sphere of influence encompassed many cultures with a strong tradition of horseback fighting. The Seleucid kingdom was also, unlike other Hellenistic empires, threatened by multiple external enemies renowned for their cavalry. And the necessity of adapted defense measures aggravated even more after losing (and becoming enemies with) some of their own important suppliers for horses and horsemen, regions like Parthia and Bactria. So it was only a natural development for the Seleucids to lay a high focus on the development of their own cavalry force. On the battlefield, the cavalry arm was therefore often the most successful in the army, often driving off the enemy cavalry in order to turn and make devastating flanking and rear charges into the enemy center. Consequently, a tendency to neglect the infantry arose. And that would turn out fatal in some battles, especially against Western enemies who fought battles primarily with their infantry."
