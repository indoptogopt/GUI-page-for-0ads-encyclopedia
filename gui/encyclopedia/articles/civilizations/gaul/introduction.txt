The Gauls were the Celtic tribes of continental Europe. Dominated by a priestly class of Druids, they featured a sophisticated culture of advanced metalworking, agriculture, trade and even road engineering. With heavy infantry and cavalry, Gallic warriors valiantly resisted Caesar's campaign of conquest and Rome's authoritarian rule.
