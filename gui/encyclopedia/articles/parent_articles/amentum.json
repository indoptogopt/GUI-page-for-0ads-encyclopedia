    "content": "The amentum (or “ankyle” in Greek) was a tool known to a number of ancient European civilizations including Greeks, Italics, Celts, and Iberians. It was used to enhance the performance of a javelin throw and was applied for sports, hunting, as well as warfare. Skilled throwers were even capable of using it on horseback.\n\nThe amentum consisted of a short leather strap tied to the javelin's butt-end. Throwers wound the amentum around the shaft a few times before gripping into the remaining loop with two fingers. When throwing, it essentially functioned as a lever, extending the arm's reach and therefore the javelin's range. Several attempts have been made to measure the amentum's efficacy - with contradictory results. Recent recreations estimate the gain at above 25% in speed and well over 50% in distance. Some past experiments recorded much larger performance improvements.\n\nMoreover, the amentum also imparted spin on the javelin, improving its flight stability and accuracy.\n\nIn the final stages of the throwing motion, the amentum slipped off the hand and stayed attached to the javelin - a key difference to similarly functioning devices like the spear-thrower. Soldiers who used them likely brought the javelins to the battlefield already prepared."
